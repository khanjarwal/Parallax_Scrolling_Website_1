<h2>What is Parallax?</h2>
<p>
    Parallax is a phenomenon in which the apparent position or direction of an object appears to change when viewed from different perspectives. This optical effect is commonly observed in everyday life and has significant applications in fields such as astronomy, photography, and engineering.<br><br>

The most straightforward example of parallax can be seen by holding a finger in front of your face and alternately closing one eye and then the other. You'll notice that your finger appears to shift its position against the background. This apparent movement is due to the slight difference in the viewing angle from each eye. The closer an object is to your eyes, the more it appears to move when viewed from different angles, which is why parallax is more pronounced with nearby objects.<br><br>

In astronomy, astronomers use the concept of parallax to measure the distance to nearby stars. They observe a star from one point in Earth's orbit and then again six months later from the opposite side of its orbit. By measuring the angle at which the star appears to shift against the background of more distant stars, they can calculate the star's distance using trigonometry.<br><br>

In photography, parallax is a consideration in cameras with viewfinders, especially in older models with optical viewfinders. The viewfinder may not show exactly what the camera's lens sees due to the offset between the viewfinder and the lens, leading to parallax error. This can affect framing and composition.<br><br>

In summary, parallax is a fascinating optical phenomenon that occurs when an object's position appears to shift when viewed from different angles or perspectives. Its applications range from measuring astronomical distances to considering framing in photography. Understanding parallax is crucial in various fields to ensure accurate measurements and observations.<br><br>
